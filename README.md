# GRETools

__GRETools__ is a collection of helpful tools for those who knows how to use terminal.  
They are developed for my personal use, but for anyone who feel them helpful, feel free to download and contribute. __HOWEVER__, code for these tools will __DIRTY__ and __NOT be further polished__ as long as they fulfill their expected functionality. 

## Install
I give you the freedom, so I will NOT offer an `install.sh`...  
Drop the files to where you want, as long as you can run them easily.  
Besides that, everything about saved data will be under `~/.gretools/`.
